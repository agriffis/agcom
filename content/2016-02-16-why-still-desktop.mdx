title: Why I still have a desktop machine
excerpt: It's all about font rendering

My development setup consists of a [Chromebook
Pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook_Pixel) and a [Digital
Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet. Alongside the browser,
browser, I connect to my droplet using [Secure
Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en)
with [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/).

I also have a desktop machine. It’s connected to a Dell 24" screen
providing 94 PPI. On that machine, I run Chrome and [GNOME
Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal), so I can work on
my desktop essentially the same way I use my Chromebook.

Occasionally I wonder why I need the desktop machine. Why not simply hook
up the Chromebook to the external monitor and keyboard when I’m at my desk?
Here’s why:

Those two screenshots were both taken on the Dell monitor. On Fedora I can
control the font rendering, especially to quantize stems to pixels. Chrome
OS won’t let me do that, and the result is... fuzzy.

It’s not a problem on the Chromebook’s panel with its 239 PPI, but on the
larger screen with triple the dot pitch, I can’t work comfortably with the
blurred font.

I love my Pixel, but if I ever want to converge my split laptop/desktop to
a single machine, then I’ll either need a 4K external screen (which my
current Pixel won’t drive) or I’ll be switching back to a Linux laptop.
