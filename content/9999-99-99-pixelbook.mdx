excerpt: Revisiting Chromebook config, seven years on.
---

Seven years ago I wrote about [using the Chromebook Pixel for
development](/2013/08/20/pixel). That setup used Crouton, the Google Secure
Shell App, mosh and tmux.

Now I have a Pixelbook. Still using mosh and tmux, but I've traded in Crouton
for Crostini, and the SSH app for the Kitty terminal emulator. I'm also using
Syncthing to share a few directories between my Chromebooks, desktop, and server
systems.

### Chromebook Pixel to Pixelbook

Like the [Pixel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook_Pixel), the
[Pixelbook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixelbook) has a 3:2
high-resolution screen, but it upgrades the keyboard from great to awesome,
replaces CPU fans with silence, and supports running Linux apps with Crostini.
It's all good.

The switch from [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) to
[Crostini](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md)
is dramatic. The older Crouton ran a Linux chroot in developer mode. It was
a beautiful and functional hack, but it had some sharp edges. Like this,
a 30-second pause on boot:

<div className="post-image">
    <a href="/img/orig/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png">
        <img alt="Screenshot: OS verification is off. Press SPACE to re-enable."
            sizes="(min-width: 36em) 28em, 100vw"
            src="/img/575/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png"
            srcSet="/img/1440/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png 1440w,
                /img/1150/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png 1080w,
                /img/1080/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png 1150w,
                /img/720/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png 720w,
                /img/575/chrome-os-verification-is-off.png 575w" />
    </a>
</div>

Whatever you do, *don't press space*, or you can say goodbye to your
painstakingly built chroot.

The newer Crostini provides a Linux virtual machine that's part of the supported
system. It runs without developer mode, so no more boot-time scares.

And great name, right? Crouton derives from chroot, and Crostini derives from
Crouton. Nice way for the supported solution to honor the community hack that
preceded it.

### Kitty on Crostini

Getting started on Crostini is [super
simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/wiki/getstarted/crostini-setup-guide):

1. Go to Chrome OS settings (chrome://settings)
2. Scroll down to "Linux (Beta)"
3. Turn it on!

### Installing Kitty

On my Fedora desktop, I recently switched from GNOME Terminal to
[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). Now I'm
spoiled by programming ligatures, so it's thrilling to get this GPU-accelerated
terminal emulator running on Chrome OS.

Behold [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) on Kitty on Chrome
OS:

<div className="post-image">
    <a href="/img/orig/kitty-on-chrome-os.png">
        <img alt="Screenshot of Kitty on Chrome OS, showing programming ligatures"
            sizes="(min-width: 36em) 28em, 100vw"
            src="/img/575/kitty-on-chrome-os.png"
            srcSet="/img/1440/kitty-on-chrome-os.png 1440w,
                    /img/1150/kitty-on-chrome-os.png 1080w,
                    /img/1080/kitty-on-chrome-os.png 1150w,
                    /img/720/kitty-on-chrome-os.png 720w,
                    /img/575/kitty-on-chrome-os.png 575w" />
    </a>
