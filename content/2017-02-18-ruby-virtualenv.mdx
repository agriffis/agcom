As a Python developer, I'm accustomed to using
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
with
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
to isolate development. Even inside a Vagrant VM or Docker container, I rely on
virtualenv to separate my project dependencies from the packages supplied by the
system.

Occasionally I find myself working in Ruby, and I'd like to isolate my
development there too. There are a couple of worthy options,
namely [RVM](https://rvm.io/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).
Similarly to virtualenv, these tools create a project-specific directory for
installing gems, and then set some environment variables such as `GEM_HOME` and
`PATH` to use that directory.

If I were working in Ruby more frequently, I'd embrace one or both of
those tools. But with virtualenv already in hand, I wondered if there would be a
way to piggyback Ruby isolation on my existing toolset. It turns out it's not
hard at all--at least if you're using virtualenvwrapper, which provides some
extra hooks for when you're activating and deactivating the virtualenv.

To use virtualenvwrapper with Ruby, first put the following in
`~/.virtualenvs/postactivate`. This will cause these environment variables to be
set whenever you do a `workon`.

    # postactivate: this hook is run after every virtualenv is activated.

    DEACTIVATE_GEM_HOME=$GEM_HOME
    export GEM_HOME=$VIRTUAL_ENV/gems
    PATH=$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH

Second, put the following in `~/.virtualenvs/predeactivate`. This will clean up
the environment when you do a `deactivate`.

    # predeactivate: this hook is run before every virtualenv is deactivated.

    if [[ -n $DEACTIVATE_GEM_HOME ]]; then
        export GEM_HOME=$DEACTIVATE_GEM_HOME
    else
        unset GEM_HOME
    fi
    unset DEACTIVATE_GEM_HOME

You don't need to clean up `PATH` because virtualenvwrapper already does that in
the default `postdeactivate` hook.

With these hooks in place, you can work on Ruby projects in isolation using the
same (Python-based) virtualenv tools that you're already familiar with. For
example:

    # Clone a popular ruby project
    git clone https://github.com/scampersand/jekyll-pants.git
    cd jekyll-pants

    # Make the virtualenv, implicitly runs workon and postactivate
    mkvirtualenv jekyll-pants

    # Install the dependencies from the Gemfile
    bundle install

    # Run the tests
    bundle exec rspec

The caveat to this approach is that you'll only have one version of Ruby
available--whatever is installed on your system. If you need to work with a
different version--or multiple versions--then you'll want to try RVM, or rbenv
with its [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) plugin.

So far, though, this setup is working well for me, and I just rely
on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/scampersand/jekyll-pants)
to test the [outlying Ruby versions](http://rubies.travis-ci.org/) when I push
to Github.
