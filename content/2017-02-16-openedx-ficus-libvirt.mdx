The
[Open edX devstack](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Running+Devstack)
expects to run on Vagrant with VirtualBox. With a few tweaks, you can use
Vagrant with KVM instead.

The instructions here are specific to the Ficus release.
If you need Eucalyptus, look [here](/2016-11-05-openedx-eucalyptus-libvirt).
{:.note}

## Rationale

At [Scampersand](https://scampersand.com) we SSH into a shared development
server that provides a stable environment and regular backups without relying on
individual hardware or configuration. That server
runs [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org) and
hosts [docker containers](https://www.docker.com)
and [KVM virtual machines](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page).

KVM and VirtualBox are mutually exclusive on Linux because they each supply a
kernel module that handles the
[CPU virtualization instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization),
so only one can be loaded at a time. Since we have an existing infrastructure
based on KVM, we'd rather run the devstack on it than need to bring up a
separate host for Virtualbox.

## Steps

If you'd like to run the Open edX devstack on KVM, these are the steps you'll
need. I'll explain these in detail below.

{:.toc-placeholder}

### Install Vagrant 1.8.7 or later, sorta

The Open edX Vagrantfile
[explicitly checks](https://github.com/edx/configuration/blob/cfabf00c0c2359b92f2121b1edc905f56c699f80/vagrant/base/devstack/Vagrantfile#L1) for
Vagrant 1.8.7 or later. This is probably motivated by the
[bug that affected old Ubuntu boxes](https://github.com/edx/configuration/issues/3385)
(even though it doesn't affect Ficus), and might also be related to the
[bug with NFS exports](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7938).

You could get the latest version (1.9.1 at the time of writing)
from [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). However on
Fedora this eventually leads to
[conflicts between Vagrant's embedded ruby and the system-installed ruby](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/issues/703).

Fedora 25 [supplies Vagrant 1.8.5](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/vagrant),
but patched for the NFS bug. I recommend using the distro-supplied package, and
planning to patch the Vagrantfile to allow it. (My modified Vagrantfile below
does just that.)

    $ sudo dnf install vagrant
    $ vagrant -v
    Vagrant 1.8.5
    $ rpm -q --changelog vagrant | head -n2
    * Tue Nov 15 2016 Vít Ondruch - 1.8.5-2
    - Fix nfs_cleanup security race and permissions (rhbz#1395040).

### Install the vagrant-libvirt plugin

"Wait, libvirt? I thought we were using KVM."

Right, so let's step back and review how this works. Vagrant is a tool for
controlling a virtual machine. The configuration for the VM is described in
`Vagrantfile`, and Vagrant depends on a virtualization provider to do the heavy
lifting. Most of the time the provider is Virtualbox, but Vagrant can also use
[VMware, Hyper-V, Docker and others](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/).

KVM is a kernel-level virtualization technology that's managed
by [libvirtd](http://libvirt.org/) in Linux distributions. In fact there used to
be a [KVM-specific provider plugin](https://github.com/adrahon/vagrant-kvm) for
Vagrant, but that's been deprecated in favor of
the [libvirt provider plugin](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt).

So in order to use Vagrant with KVM, you need the vagrant-libvirt plugin. You
can install it like this:

    $ sudo dnf install vagrant-libvirt

### Enable user for vagrant with libvirt

The libvirt daemon will need to know that you're authorized to manage virtual
machines. The easiest way to do this is to add yourself to the libvirt group:

    $ sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER

There's no need to log out and back in, since libvirtd checks group membership
directly rather than via process inheritance.

It's a good idea to make sure that `virsh` works properly before proceeding:

    $ virsh --connect=qemu:///system sysinfo

If that command produces some XML output, you should be good to go. If it
doesn't, then you might need to investigate since vagrant-libvirt isn't likely
to work either.

### Mutate the devstack box

The box image provided by edX is specific to to VirtualBox. Use
the [vagrant-mutate](https://github.com/sciurus/vagrant-mutate) plugin to
convert it for libvirt/KVM. This isn't available from Fedora, so you'll have to
install it locally:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-mutate
    Installing the 'vagrant-mutate' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
    Installed the plugin 'vagrant-mutate (1.2.0)'!

    $ vagrant box add --name ficus-devstack-2017-02-07 --provider virtualbox \
        http://files.edx.org/vagrant-images/ficus-devstack-2017-02-07.box
    ==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
    ==> box: Adding box 'ficus-devstack-2017-02-07' (v0) for provider: virtualbox
        box: Downloading: http://files.edx.org/vagrant-images/ficus-devstack-2017-02-07.box
    ==> box: Successfully added box 'ficus-devstack-2017-02-07' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!

    $ vagrant mutate ficus-devstack-2017-02-07 libvirt
    Converting ficus-devstack-2017-02-07 from virtualbox to libvirt.
        (100.00/100%)
    The box ficus-devstack-2017-02-07 (libvirt) is now ready to use.

You can inspect what this does on the filesystem in your `.vagrant.d` directory.

    $ tree ~/.vagrant.d/boxes
    /home/aron/.vagrant.d/boxes
    └── ficus-devstack-2017-02-07
        └── 0
            ├── libvirt
            │   ├── Vagrantfile
            │   ├── box.img
            │   └── metadata.json
            └── virtualbox
                ├── Vagrantfile
                ├── box-disk1.vmdk
                ├── box.ovf
                ├── metadata.json
                └── vagrant_private_key

Notice that the `vagrant_private_key` wasn't included in the migration. While it
would be possible to copy this manually, the easier workaround is to set
`config.ssh.password`, and this is the approach already taken in the custom
`Vagrantfile` you'll download next.

### Repair the network configuration

Now you have `ficus-devstack-2017-02-07` mutated to run under libvirt, but if
you try to boot it up, it will hang at this line:

    ==> default: Waiting for domain to get an IP address...

The problem is that the
[network interface is named differently when running under libvirt](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/issues/609),
so the networking configuration in the guest doesn't apply properly.

There's a pretty easy fix for this, using a program
called [guestfish](http://libguestfs.org/guestfish.1.html). This nifty tool lets
you crack open the virtual machine image to make small edits. The two small
edits you need to make are: (1) modify grub's kernel parameters so the network
interface is predictably named, and (2) add the network configuration.

    $ sudo dnf install libguestfs-tools-c
    $ guestfish -a ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/ficus-devstack-2017-02-07/0/libvirt/box.img

    Welcome to guestfish, the guest filesystem shell for
    editing virtual machine filesystems and disk images.

    Type: 'help' for help on commands
          'man' to read the manual
          'quit' to quit the shell

    ><fs> run
    ><fs> mount /dev/vagrant-vg/root /
    ><fs> mount /dev/sda1 /boot
    ><fs> edit /etc/default/grub

This will drop you into an editor. Change the value of
`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` so it reads like this:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"

Save and exit, which puts you back at the guestfish prompt. First, verify that
your change was written properly:

    ><fs> grep quiet /etc/default/grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"

Next, run `update-grub` in the context of the guest filesystem. This will
rewrite the grub configuration at `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` with the new kernel
parameters.

    ><fs> command /usr/sbin/update-grub
    ><fs> grep quiet /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    linux /vmlinuz-4.4.0-31-generic root=/dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root ro  quiet net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0
    linux /vmlinuz-4.4.0-31-generic root=/dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root ro  quiet net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0

Finally, add the network configuration for `eth0`:

    ><fs> write /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0 "auto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n"
    ><fs> quit

If you tried to start Vagrant without making these changes first,
you'll need to remove the box image from libvirt storage. Next time you run
Vagrant it will re-import from your modified box.

    virsh vol-delete ficus-devstack-2017-02-07_vagrant_box_image_0.img --pool default

### Download the modified devstack Vagrantfile

The edX-provided Vagrantfile assumes Virtualbox, so I've provided a modified
Vagrantfile that supports libvirt/KVM. You can inspect the differences
[here](https://github.com/edx/configuration/compare/open-release/ficus.master...scampersand:scampersand/ficus.libvirt-kvm).

You should download this into a new directory where the sources will
also eventually be checked out.

    $ mkdir devstack
    $ cd devstack
    $ curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scampersand/configuration/scampersand/ficus.libvirt-kvm/vagrant/release/devstack/Vagrantfile

### Fire it up!

At this point you can start devstack. Since the
[upstream Vagrantfile still defaults to Eucalyptus](https://github.com/edx/configuration/blob/open-release/ficus.master/vagrant/release/devstack/Vagrantfile#L67),
you'll need to override it by setting `OPENEDX_RELEASE` in the environment.

    $ export OPENEDX_RELEASE=open-release/ficus

If you will have more than one user running on the same host, then you should
start vagrant with `VAGRANT_NO_PORTS=1` to avoid listening on a bunch of
localhost ports that will collide between users. Instead you can access the VM
by its own IP address as shown below.

    $ VAGRANT_NO_PORTS=1 vagrant up --provider=libvirt

    ...

When this finishes, you can start Studio or LMS just like the
[edX-provided instructions](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Running+Devstack):

    $ vagrant ssh
    vagrant@vagrant:~$ sudo su edxapp
    edxapp@vagrant:~/edx-platform$ paver devstack studio  # or lms

If you ran with `VAGRANT_NO_PORTS=1` then you'll need the IP address of the
virtual machine:

    $ vagrant ssh-config
    Host default
      HostName 192.168.121.155
      User vagrant
      Port 22
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      PasswordAuthentication no
      IdentityFile /home/aron/devstack/.vagrant/machines/default/libvirt/private_key
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      LogLevel FATAL

Use the IP address shown in the output construct the URL. For example, in the
output above, the LMS will be on `http://192.168.121.155:8000` and Studio is on
`http://192.168.121.155:8001`

Note that this IP address is a private IPv4 address as defined
by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918), so if you're running on
a server separate from your own workstation, you'll need some additional network
hookup. I'll show you what I use in a following article.
