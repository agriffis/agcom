title: httplib2 debug in a threaded app

excerpt: Duck-typing to the rescue

A couple months ago I blogged about my frustration with httplib logging.
Andrew Dalke suggested that I should replace
[sys.stdout](http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.stdout). His
suggestion sent me googling, which turned up an [old email from
Guido](https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082804/http://www.python.org/search/hypermail/python-1994q1/0169.html).
Add threading.local and we have a solution!

We need a duck-typed replacement for sys.stdout that behaves like a writeable
file, but also provides the ability to capture to thread-local storage. One of
the ways to use threading.local is to subclass it. An instance of this subclass
will have per-thread attributes, even if the instance itself is common to
multiple threads.

Since [StringIO](http://docs.python.org/library/stringio.html) intentionally
doesn't implement isatty(), we also need to make sure that gets passed through
to the underlying file (we do this by catching the exception in getattr). And
since we like seeing HTTP transactions when we're debugging, we include a
writethrough mode that provides simultaneous capture and print.

```python
import cStringIO, threading

class LocalCapturingWriter(threading.local):
    def __init__(self, fp, writethrough=False):
        self.__dict__['_fp'] = fp
        self.__dict__['_stringio'] = None
        self.__dict__['_writethrough'] = writethrough

    def start_capture(self):
        self.__dict__['_stringio'] = cStringIO.StringIO()

    def stop_capture(self):
        v = self._stringio.getvalue()
        self._stringio.close()
        self.__dict__['_stringio'] = None
        return v

    def write(self, s):
        if self._stringio:
            result = self._stringio.write(s)
        if not self._stringio or self._writethrough:
            result = self._fp.write(s)
        return result

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if self._stringio is not None:
            try:
                return getattr(self._stringio, name)
            except:
                pass
        return getattr(self._fp, name)

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if self._stringio:
            setattr(self._stringio, name, value)
        if not self._stringio or self._writethrough:
            setattr(self._fp, name, value)
```

And here's how to use it. First, the global settings:

```python
import httplib2, sys
httplib2.debuglevel = 1
sys.stdout = LocalCapturingWriter(sys.stdout)
```

Then the code that runs in a thread to capture the debugging output. This
will work as expected even in multiple threads simultaneously.

```python
sys.stdout.start_capture()
try:
    response, content = \
        httplib2.Http().request("http://n01se.net")
finally:
    debug_trace = sys.stdout.stop_capture()

# Note that httplib2 doesn't include the content in its
# debug output.
debug_trace += "content: %r\n" % content
```

We're now using this in our Django app, with a custom Exception class (to
hold the captured trace) and middleware that knows to look for it. The end
result is that every time an exception occurs due to a problem talking to
a backend server, the exception email includes the httplib2 trace. Yeah!
