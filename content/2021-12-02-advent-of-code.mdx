## Day 2a

My solution:

```typescript
export const d2a = ({input = inputs.d2, dbg}: DayProps) =>
  R.pipe(
    Array.from(input.matchAll(/(\w+)\s+(\d+)/g)),
    R.map(m => ({dir: m[1], mag: parseInt(m[2])})),
    R.reduce(
      ({x, z}, {dir, mag}) => ({
        x: dir === 'forward' ? x + mag : x,
        z: dir === 'up' ? z - mag : dir === 'down' ? z + mag : z,
      }),
      {x: 0, z: 0},
    ),
    dbg,
    ({x, z}) => x * z,
  )
```

I'm really liking how Remeda infers types down the pipe. While working on this
with Neovim's LSP support, it would highlight red anytime my anticipated input
didn't match the output of the previous function.

Here's the result with the sample input:

<Advent day={2} part="a" input={`
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
`} debug />

and here it is with my input:

<Advent day={2} part="a" debug />

## Day 2b

There's something heartwarmingly familiar about this pattern in Advent of Code:

> The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought

Minor change to the reduction, nothing more:

```typescript
export const d2b = ({input = inputs.d2, dbg}: DayProps) =>
  R.pipe(
    Array.from(input.matchAll(/(\w+)\s+(\d+)/g)),
    R.map(m => ({cmd: m[1], n: parseInt(m[2])})),
    R.reduce(
      ({x, z, aim}, {cmd, n}) =>
        cmd === 'forward'
          ? {x: x + n, z: z + n * aim, aim}
          : cmd === 'up'
          ? {aim: aim - n, x, z}
          : {aim: aim + n, x, z},
      {x: 0, z: 0, aim: 0},
    ),
    dbg,
    ({x, z}) => x * z,
  )
```

Sample result:

<Advent day={2} part="b" input={`
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
`} debug />

and my result:

<Advent day={2} part="b" debug />
