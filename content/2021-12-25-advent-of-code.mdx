This year I'm tackling [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) again, after
taking last year off. Two years ago, [I used
Clojure](https://github.com/agriffis/adventofcode2019); this time I'll tilt
pedestrian and use TypeScript.

The idea is to do it right here, in my blog, built on
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). What this means is
that my solutions will run in your browser, directly in the individual blog
posts, rather than running on the server in advance.

Here are the days I've finished so far:

## How it works

Some Advent of Code problems take seconds-to-minutes to run to completion. Two
misbehaviors we need to avoid: (1) running the solution in Next.js server-side
rendering, (2) holding up client-side rendering of the post content.

We can solve both of these with a React effect. Effects don't run on the server,
instead they wait until after the initial render on the client. For example,
here's a React component that starts with an empty result, then runs the
function in an effect on the client browser:

```typescript
import {useEffect, useState} from 'react'

const Component = () => {
  const [result, setResult] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    const result = longRunningFunction()
    setResult(result)
  }, [])

  return <p>Result: {result}</p>
}
```

However there is a third misbehavior we would like to avoid: taking the browser
hostage while the function runs. If we want the client free to rerender while
the function runs, without waiting for the end, then we need to move computation
off the main thread. For this we can use a [web
worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

So we start with a React hook that will load our worker and simultaneously send
it a message to get started:

```typescript
const useWorker = (message: any, cb: any) => {
  const [worker] = useState(() => {
    if (typeof Worker !== 'undefined') {
      const worker = new Worker(new URL('./advent.worker.ts', import.meta.url))
      worker.addEventListener('message', (event: any) => cb(event.data))
      worker.postMessage(message)
      return worker
    }
  })

  // Terminate on unmount
  useEffect(() => () => worker.terminate(), [worker])

  return worker
}
```

The worker listens for messages and runs the appropriate day's function with the
given input:

```typescript
self.addEventListener('message', (event: any) => {
  const props = event.data as AdventProps
  const fn = days[`d${props.day}${props.part}`] || days[`d${props.day}`]
  const result = fn(props)
  self.postMessage({result})
})
```
