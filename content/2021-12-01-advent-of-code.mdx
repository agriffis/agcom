The problem is [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1).

## Day 1a

```typescript
export const d1a = ({input}: DayProps) =>
  R.pipe(
    input,
    s => s.trim().split(/\s+/),
    R.map(parseInt),
    R.reduce.indexed((n, d, i, ds) => n + Number(i && d > ds[i - 1]), 0),
  ).toString()
```

`R` in this case is [Remeda](https://remedajs.com/), which is like
[Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) but tuned for TypeScript.

Interesting stuff:

- Using `R.map` instead of `Array.prototype.map` avoids the whole issue of
  `parseInt` taking a radix parameter. Remeda will only pass a single argument
  to `R.map`; if you want more, you have to use `R.map.indexed`.

- Converting booleans to numbers is remarkably soothing. Think of the keypresses
  saved.

Here's the result with the sample input:

<Advent day={1} part="a" input="199 200 208 210 200 207 240 269 260 263" />

and here's the result with [my own
input](https://github.com/agriffis/agcom/blob/4b52572861b4d1273328077bb59770649448c5ba/components/advent-inputs.ts#L1-L125):

<Advent day={1} part="a" />

## Day 1b

The problem statement says that we're using a sliding window to mitigate noise
in the input. The prescribed implementation uses a sum over the window, though,
so in reality it's just comparing the start of the previous window with the end
of the new window:

```
Window 1: A + B + C
Window 2: B + C + D

(B + C + D) > (A + B + C) â‰¡ D > A
```

Apart from `dbg` (will explain below), the only difference from
the first part is the index for comparison:

```typescript
export const d1b = ({input, dbg}: DayProps) =>
  R.pipe(
    input,
    s => s.trim().split(/\s+/),
    R.map(parseInt),
    R.reduce.indexed(
      (n, d, i, ds) =>
        n + Number(i > 2 && d > ds[i - 3] && (dbg(d, '(increased)'), true)),
      0,
    ),
  ).toString()
```

Here's the result with the sample input, with debugging enabled:

<Advent day={1} part="b" input="199 200 208 210 200 207 240 269 260 263" debug />

and here's the result with my own input:

<Advent day={1} part="b" />
