This year I'm tackling [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) again, after
taking last year off. Two years ago, [I used
Clojure](https://github.com/agriffis/adventofcode2019); this time I'll tilt
pedestrian and use TypeScript.

The idea is to do it right here, in my blog, built on
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). At a minimum we'll
get code and raw answers on the screen; if we're lucky, there'll be graphics.

Want to know what MDX looks like? It's Markdown with React instead of HTML.
Check out [this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agriffis/agcom/main/content/2021-12-01-advent-of-code.mdx).

Let's dive in and we'll loop back to blog mechanics at the end.

## Day 1a

The problem is [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1).

My solution:

```typescript
export const d1a = ({input}: DayProps) =>
  R.pipe(
    input,
    s => s.trim().split(/\s+/),
    R.map(parseInt),
    R.reduce.indexed((n, d, i, ds) => n + Number(i && d > ds[i - 1]), 0),
  ).toString()
```

`R` in this case is [Remeda](https://remedajs.com/), which is like
[Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) but tuned for TypeScript.

Interesting stuff:

- Using `R.map` instead of `Array.prototype.map` avoids the whole issue of
  `parseInt` taking a radix parameter. Remeda will only pass a single argument
  to `R.map`; if you want more, you have to use `R.map.indexed`.

- Converting booleans to numbers is remarkably soothing. Think of the keypresses
  saved.

Here's the result with the sample input:

<Advent day={1} part="a" input="199 200 208 210 200 207 240 269 260 263" />

and here's the result with [my own
input)(https://github.com/agriffis/agcom/blob/4b52572861b4d1273328077bb59770649448c5ba/components/advent-inputs.ts#L1-L125):

<Advent day={1} part="a" />

## Day 1b

The problem statement says that we're using a sliding window to mitigate noise
in the input. The prescribed implementation uses a sum over the window, though,
so in reality it's just comparing the start of the previous window with the end
of the new window:

```
Window 1: A + B + C
Window 2: B + C + D

(B + C + D) - (A + B + C) = D - A
```

Apart from `dbg` (will explain below), the only difference in my solution from
the first part is the index for comparison:

```typescript
export const d1b = ({input, dbg}: DayProps) =>
  R.pipe(
    input,
    s => s.trim().split(/\s+/),
    R.map(parseInt),
    R.reduce.indexed(
      (n, d, i, ds) =>
        n + Number(i > 2 && d > ds[i - 3] && (dbg(d, '(increased)'), true)),
      0,
    ),
  ).toString()
```

Here's the result with the sample input, with debugging enabled:

<Advent day={1} part="b" input="199 200 208 210 200 207 240 269 260 263" debug />

and here's the result with my own input:

<Advent day={1} part="b" />

## Worker and debug

Some Advent of Code problems take seconds-to-minutes to run to completion. Two
things we want to avoid: (1) running the solution in server-side rendering, (2)
holding up client-side rendering.

Kill two render-blockers with one `useEffect()`--it doesn't run on the server,
and it doesn't hold up the initial render on the client:

```typescript
import {useEffect, useState} from 'react'

const Component = () => {
  const [result, setResult] = useState<string>('')

  useEffect(() => {
    const result = longRunningFunction()
    setResult(result)
  }, [])

  return <p>Result: {result}</p>
}
```

But... what about debug? We could `console.log` but where's the fun in that?
If we want the client to rerender while the function runs, without waiting for
the end, then we need to move computation off the main thread. Put your hands
together and give a warm welcome to [web
workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

So we start with a React hook:

```typescript
const useWorker = (message: any, cb: any) => {
  const [worker] = useState(() => {
    if (typeof Worker !== 'undefined') {
      const worker = new Worker(new URL('./advent.worker.ts', import.meta.url))
      worker.addEventListener('message', (event: any) => cb(event.data))
      worker.postMessage(message)
      return worker
    }
  })

  // Terminate on unmount
  useEffect(() => () => worker.terminate(), [worker])

  return worker
}
```

The hook starts a worker, attaches a listener, sends a message, and prepares to
fire the poor bastard as soon as the company's squeezed the last ounce of profit
from his labor.

But work he does, passing messages between the component and the solution
functions you saw earlier in this post:

```typescript
self.addEventListener('message', (event: any) => {
  console.log('worker received:', event.data)
  const props = event.data as AdventProps
  const result = days[`d${event.data.day}${event.data.part}`]({
    ...(event.data as AdventProps),
    dbg: props.debug
      ? (...args: any) => {
          self.postMessage({debug: args.join(' ')})
        }
      : () => {},
  })
  self.postMessage({result})
})
```

Finally, debugging! If the calling component passes the `debug` prop then the
`dbg` function can post back in-progress messages. The component renders those
messages alongside the result, whenever it deigns to arrive:

```
const AnyDay: Day = (props: AdventProps) => {
  const [debug, setDebug] = useState<string>('')
  const [result, setResult] = useState<string>('')

  useWorker(props, data => {
    console.log('received from worker', data)
    if (data.result) {
      setResult(data.result)
    } else if (data.debug) {
      setDebug(debug => debug + '\n' + data.debug)
    }
  })

  return (
    <>
      {result}
      {debug && (
        <>
          {'\n\n'}DEBUG:{debug}
        </>
      )}
    </>
  )
}
```
