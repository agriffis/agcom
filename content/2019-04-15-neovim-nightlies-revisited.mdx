Last month I kicked off [Neovim nightly builds in Fedora
COPR](/2019-03-02-neovim-nightly-builds). Since then
something interesting happened: the maintainer for the Neovim package in
Fedora [accepted
a change](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/neovim/pull-request/2) to
build Neovim with LuaJIT instead of Lua 5.3.

This is significant because Neovim upstream [explicitly depends on Lua
5.1](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#why-lua-51-instead-of-lua-53)
(which LuaJIT implements). Most open source projects use [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org) (major.minor.patch) so version 5.3 would
normally indicate a non-breaking update to version 5.1. But Lua is an
outlier--it doesn't use semantic versioning. Here's what [Lua's versions
page](https://www.lua.org/versions.html) says (emphasis mine):

> The releases of Lua are numbered x.y.z, where **x.y is the version** and **z is the release.**
>
> Different releases of the same version correspond to bug fixes. Different
> releases of the same version have the same reference manual, the same
> virtual machine, and are binary compatible (ABI compatible).
>
> **Different versions are really different...**

By switching the Neovim package to use LuaJIT, the Fedora package ensures
compatibility with Lua code in the core Neovim package as well as external
plugins written against the Lua 5.1 API.

Also, you just might notice it's
[faster](https://luajit.org/performance_x86.html).

Since this change landed in Fedora, I updated the nightly COPR builds to do
the same. I also cleaned up the build process using [rpkg spec
templates](https://docs.pagure.org/rpkg-util/spec_templates_from_scratch.html)
instead of messily rewriting the spec for each update. See
[neovim.spec.rpkg](https://github.com/agriffis/neovim/blob/copr/neovim.spec.rpkg)
and
[python-neovim.spec.rpkg](https://github.com/agriffis/pynvim/blob/copr/python-neovim.spec.rpkg)

One more thing: if you're on Fedora 31 (Rawhide) there's no longer
a python2-neovim package because [Python 2 will be
EOL](https://pythonclock.org) shortly after [Fedora 31
release](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/31/Schedule).

    sudo dnf copr enable agriffis/neovim-nightly
    sudo dnf upgrade neovim python3-neovim     # Fedora 31/Rawhide
    sudo dnf upgrade neovim python{2,3}-neovim # Everybody else
