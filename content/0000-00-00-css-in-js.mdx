I first learned web development with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
The Python server generated HTML from
[templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/), and a separate (Ruby) process
generated CSS from [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

In theory, the system was loosely coupled with strong separation of concerns.
The back-end developers could build their database models and HTML templates,
the designers could write CSS to make it look nice, and the front-end devs could
spin some [jQuery](https://jquery.com) to make it interactive.

In practice, the coupling was tight and brittle. The CSS and JavaScript both
depended on relatively stable structure and class names, so when the markup
changed, the others often needed an accompanying change. The dependencies
between these were hard to track and test, because they relied on matching
string class names between separate codebases.
