The
[Open edX devstack](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Running+Devstack)
expects to run on Vagrant with VirtualBox. With a few tweaks, you can use
Vagrant with KVM instead.

The instructions here are specific to the Eucalyptus release.

{:.note}

## Rationale
{:.no_toc}

At [Scampersand](https://scampersand.com) we SSH into a shared development
server that provides a stable environment and regular backups without relying on
individual hardware or configuration. That server
runs [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org) and
hosts [docker containers](https://www.docker.com)
and [KVM virtual machines](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page).

KVM and VirtualBox are mutually exclusive on Linux because they each supply a
kernel module that handles the
[CPU virtualization instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization),
so only one can be loaded at a time. Since we have an existing infrastructure
based on KVM, we'd rather run the devstack on it than need to bring up a
separate host for Virtualbox.

## Steps
{:.no_toc}

If you'd like to run the Open edX devstack on KVM, these are the steps you'll
need. I'll explain these in detail below.

### Install Vagrant 1.8.6 or later

Vagrant prior to 1.8.6 has a [bug that affects old Ubuntu boxes](https://github.com/edx/configuration/issues/3385).
The current release of Open edX--known as Eucalyptus--is based on Ubuntu 12.04
which is affected by this bug.

You can check what version of Vagrant you have:

    $ vagrant -v
    Vagrant 1.8.6

If the version reported is older than 1.8.6 (or if you don't have Vagrant
already) go ahead and get the latest
from [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

Also note that if you're planning for more than one user to run devstack on the
same host, you'll actually need the version *after* 1.8.6 to fix
a [bug with NFS exports](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7938).
Unfortunately that version isn't released as I'm writing this, but if you're
impatient then you can find a workaround
in [my pull request](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/pull/7939/files).
This isn't necessary for single-user systems, so don't sweat it in that case.

### Install the vagrant-libvirt plugin

"Wait, libvirt? I thought we were using KVM."

Right, so let's step back and review how this works. Vagrant is a tool for
controlling a virtual machine. The configuration for the VM is described in
`Vagrantfile`, and Vagrant depends on a virtualization provider to do the heavy
lifting. Most of the time the provider is Virtualbox, but Vagrant can also use
[VMware, Hyper-V, Docker and others](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/).

KVM is a kernel-level virtualization technology that's managed
by [libvirtd](http://libvirt.org/) in Linux distributions. In fact there used to
be a [KVM-specific provider plugin](https://github.com/adrahon/vagrant-kvm) for
Vagrant, but that's been deprecated in favor of
the [libvirt provider plugin](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt).

So in order to use Vagrant with KVM, you need the vagrant-libvirt plugin. You
can install it like this:

    $ sudo dnf install libvirt-devel    # Fedora
    $ sudo apt-get install libvirt-dev  # Ubuntu
    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt

This approach installs it
from [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-libvirt), which gives you
the most recent version the author has released. The distributions also package
the plugin so you can install it with `dnf` (Fedora) or `apt-get` (Ubuntu), but
they're usually a few versions behind.

### Enable user for vagrant with libvirt

The libvirt daemon will need to know that you're authorized to manage virtual
machines. The easiest way to do this is to add yourself to the libvirt group:

    $ sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER

There's no need to log out and back in, since libvirtd checks group membership
directly rather than via process inheritance.

It's a good idea to make sure that `virsh` works properly before proceeding:

    $ virsh --connect=qemu:///system sysinfo

If that command produces some XML output, you should be good to go. If it
doesn't, then you might need to investigate since vagrant-libvirt isn't likely
to work either.

{% comment %}
You should make sure that `virsh` works properly before proceeding. Since
vagrant-libvirt
[always uses the system qemu session](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/blob/9682161c8a10122222c0f39328a1ebff1bcfaae2/lib/vagrant-libvirt/config.rb#L439).
you can either use the `--connect` command-line option or set the environment
variable, as shown here:

### Mutate the devstack box

The box image provided by edX is specific to to VirtualBox. Use
the [vagrant-mutate](https://github.com/sciurus/vagrant-mutate) plugin to
convert it for libvirt/KVM.

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-mutate
    Installing the 'vagrant-mutate' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
    Installed the plugin 'vagrant-mutate (1.2.0)'!

    $ vagrant box add --name eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01 --provider virtualbox \
        http://files.edx.org/vagrant-images/eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01.box
    ==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
    ==> box: Adding box 'eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01' (v0) for provider: virtualbox
        box: Downloading: http://files.edx.org/vagrant-images/eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01.box
    ==> box: Successfully added box 'eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!

    $ vagrant mutate eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01 libvirt
    Converting eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01 from virtualbox to libvirt.
        (100.00/100%)
    The box eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01 (libvirt) is now ready to use.

You can inspect what this does on the filesystem in your `.vagrant.d` directory.

    $ tree ~/.vagrant.d/boxes
    /home/aron/.vagrant.d/boxes
    └── eucalyptus-devstack-2016-09-01
        └── 0
            ├── libvirt
            │   ├── Vagrantfile
            │   ├── box.img
            │   └── metadata.json
            └── virtualbox
                ├── Vagrantfile
                ├── box-disk1.vmdk
                ├── box.ovf
                ├── metadata.json
                └── vagrant_private_key

Notice that the `vagrant_private_key` wasn't included in the migration. While it
would be possible to copy this manually, the easier workaround is to set
`config.ssh.password`, and this is the approach already taken in the custom
`Vagrantfile` you'll download next.

### Download the modified devstack Vagrantfile

The edX-provided Vagrantfile assumes Virtualbox, so I've provided a modified
Vagrantfile that supports libvirt/KVM. You can inspect the differences
[here](https://github.com/edx/configuration/compare/open-release/eucalyptus.master...scampersand:scampersand/eucalyptus.libvirt-kvm).

You should download this into a new directory where the sources will
also eventually be checked out.

    $ mkdir devstack
    $ cd devstack
    $ curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scampersand/configuration/scampersand/eucalyptus.libvirt-kvm/vagrant/release/devstack/Vagrantfile

### Fire it up!

At this point you can start devstack. If you will have more than one user
running on the same host, then you should start it with `VAGRANT_NO_PORTS=1` to
avoid listening on a bunch of localhost ports that will collide between users.
Instead you can access the VM by its own IP address as shown below.

    $ VAGRANT_NO_PORTS=1 vagrant up --provider=libvirt

When this finishes, you can start Studio or LMS just like the
[edX-provided instructions](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Running+Devstack):

    $ vagrant ssh
    vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo su edxapp
    edxapp@precise64:~/edx-platform$ paver devstack studio  # or lms

If you ran with `VAGRANT_NO_PORTS=1` then you'll need the IP address of the
virtual machine:

    $ vagrant ssh-config
    Host default
      HostName 192.168.121.155
      User vagrant
      Port 22
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      PasswordAuthentication no
      IdentityFile /home/aron/devstack/.vagrant/machines/default/libvirt/private_key
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      LogLevel FATAL

Use the IP address shown in the output construct the URL. For example, in the
output above, the LMS will be on `http://192.168.121.155:8000` and Studio is on
`http://192.168.121.155:8001`

Note that this IP address is a private IPv4 address as defined
by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918), so if you're running on
a server separate from your own workstation, you'll need some additional network
hookup. I'll show you what I use in a following article.
