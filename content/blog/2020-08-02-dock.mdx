Today I needed to build some Debian packages, and I thought I'd do it in
a container on my Fedora desktop. I've used Docker previously for development
and deployment, but never for quick personal containers, and it was easier than
I imagined. There are just two steps: make the image, and run the container.

I anticipate that I'll accumulate a few of these quick distro containers, so I'm
keeping Dockerfiles in `~/docks` and using a script `dock` to run them.

## Make the image

Here's my Dockerfile for Debian Buster. It installs some packages, fakes the
Keybase redirector, and makes my user. It's important that the "aron" user here
has the same UID and GID as my host user, so that I'll have permissions to read
and write my home directory mounted in the container.

    # ~/docks/Dockerfile-buster
    FROM debian:buster

    # Enable source repos for apt-get build-dep.
    RUN sed -ni 'p;s/^deb /deb-src /p' /etc/apt/sources.list

    # Base system and build requirements.
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
            build-essential \
            devscripts \
            fakeroot \
            mini-dinstall \
            msmtp \
            msmtp-mta \
            ncurses-term \
            sudo \
            vim \
        && apt-get build-dep -y \
            kitty \
            mosh

    # Enable running sudo without a password.
    RUN echo '%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers

    # Avoid locale warnings with LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    RUN sed -i '/^# en_US.UTF-8/s/^# //' /etc/locale.gen
    RUN locale-gen

    # This symlink takes the place of the keybase redirector in the container.
    RUN ln -s /run/user/10208/keybase/kbfs /keybase

    # Set up my user and make it the default.
    RUN groupadd -g 10208 aron
    RUN useradd -u 10208 -g aron -G sudo -s /bin/bash -m aron
    USER aron
    WORKDIR /home/aron

Building and tagging the image using this Dockerfile:

    ✸ docker build --tag dock-buster -f Dockerfile-buster ~/docks
    ...
    Successfully tagged dock-buster:latest

## Run the container

Running the container looks like this:

    aron@fedora ✸ dock buster
    aron@buster ✸ cat /etc/debian_version
    10.4

The `dock` script is a wrapper around the `docker` command to run with some
arguments. It looks like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # dock -- run a Docker container with my stuff in it
    #

    main() {
        declare keybase=/run/user/$UID/keybase

        docker run --name=$1 --hostname=$1 -it -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK -e TERM --rm \
            --mount type=bind,source=$HOME,target=$HOME,bind-propagation=rslave \
            --mount type=bind,source=$keybase,target=$keybase,bind-propagation=rslave \
            --mount type=bind,source=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK,target=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK \
            dock-$1 /bin/bash

        exit
    }

    main "$@"

That command might seem daunting, but it's pretty straightforward:

* Call the container `buster` when we run `dock buster`.
* Pass through `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `TERM` in the environment.
* Remove the container automatically between runs.
* Bind-mount home directory, keybase dir and the SSH agent socket.
* Use the image called `dock-buster`, and run `/bin/bash`.

Docker's
[bind-propagation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation)
flag was new to me. Normally sub-mounts of the original mount aren't exposed to
the container, but using `rslave` allows them to be shared. For example, I have
`/home/aron/Dropbox` mounted as a separate filesystem, and
`bind-propagation=rslave` allows me to access Dropbox in the container.

This is especially important for the Keybase mount. The dir I actually wanted to
bind-mount was `/run/user/$UID/keybase/kbfs` but trying to share that directly
yields a permission error. This is because the Docker daemon, running as root,
isn't allowed to access the kbfs fuse-mounts of individual users. Bind mounting
the parent dir with `bind-propagation=rslave` allows my user, who is allowed by
the fuse-mount, to access kbfs in the container.

The other interesting thing here is the bind mount of the SSH socket. That
allows SSH in the container to access my SSH agent running in the host, so that
I don't need to enter my password for git commands.

## Putting it together

At the end of this I have a directory `~/docks` that contains Dockerfiles for
distro experimentation, and a script `~/bin/dock` to run them conveniently.
