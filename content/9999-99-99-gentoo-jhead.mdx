title: Adjusting Exif Date/Time with jhead

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Working on some digital photos today, I found the Date/Time field in the Exif header was set to EDT, because that&#8217;s how my camera was set (I&#8217;ve changed it now to UTC).  This is problematic because I recently took a trip to Italy, and of course the times on those photos don&#8217;t make sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$ jhead IMG_0356.JPG | grep ^Date
Date/Time    : 2005:09:20 09:46:49
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the times changed to UTC on my existing pictures, I used the following sequence:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$ jhead -ta+4:00 *.JPG
$ TZ=UTC jhead -ft */*.JPG
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first command advances the Exif Date/Time on all the pictures by 4 hours, which is the difference between EDT and UTC.  The second command copies the Exif Date/Time to the file&#8217;s mtime, pretending that we&#8217;re presently in UTC so that it doesn&#8217;t attempt to adjust.  The final result is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$ jhead IMG_0356.JPG | grep ^Date
Date/Time    : 2005:09:20 13:46:49
$ ls -l IMG_0356.JPG
-rw-r--r--  1 agriffis agriffis 3.9M Sep 20 09:46 IMG_0356.JPG
</pre>
