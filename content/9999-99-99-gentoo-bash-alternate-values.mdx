Many people are familiar with the bourne shell constructs for default or
alternate values, but there’s a detail that I suspect most people don’t know:
the semantic difference between the bash and bourne shell syntax. Here is the
summary:

```bash
${var-word}    # insert $var, or default value if var is unset
${var+word}    # insert alternate value if var is set
${var:-word}   # insert $var, or default value if var is unset or null
${var:+word}   # insert alternate value if var is set and non-null
```

Do you see the difference between these? The first two are classic bourne shell
syntax, the second two are bash additions (they’re also present in most bourne
shell derivatives, including posix shell). The semantic difference is that the
first two only check for the existence of the variable, but the second two
additionally check that it has non-zero length.

Here is an example of when the older bourne shell syntax is useful. Imagine you
have a configuration file in shell syntax, so you’re going to source it into the
current shell to pick up the variable settings. Something like this, which
happens to work because Gentoo’s /etc/make.conf is valid shell syntax:

```bash
source /etc/make.conf
```

You might like to know if `GENTOO_MIRRORS` is set by the environment or by the
configuration file, even if it was set to a null string. If it is unset after
consulting both sources, we’ll call that an error. Here’s one way you could do
it:

```bash
if [[ -z ${GENTOO_MIRRORS+set} ]]; then
  source /etc/make.conf
fi
if [[ -z ${GENTOO_MIRRORS+set} ]]; then
  echo "Error: GENTOO_MIRRORS not found in environment or /etc/make.conf" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```
