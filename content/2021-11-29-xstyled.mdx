title: How do I fork xstyled?

[xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/) is a wrapper for
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) that provides theming and
props-based styling similar to [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/). I've
been using it for personal and professional projects, inevitably [sticking my
nose in upstream
development](https://github.com/search?l=&q=author%3Aagriffis+repo%3Agregberge%2Fxstyled&type=commits).

I want to spin my own xstyled packages for features that are waiting to be
merged, or that may never find their way upstream. Because xstyled is a monorepo
with multiple output packages, it's unfortunately not as simple as just changing
the name in `package.json`:

```
xstyled
└── packages
    ├── babel-preset-emotion-css-prop
    ├── core
    ├── emotion
    ├── prop-types
    ├── styled-components
    ├── system
    └── util
```

## Step 1: Prep

Clone and fork. I had to rename the remotes after forking, because
[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) [requires the remote to be named
`origin`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/2808).

```bash
hub clone gregberge/xstyled
hub fork
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote rename agriffis origin
git checkout -b fork
git push --set-upstream origin fork
```

## Step 2: Rename

Change the names of the packages everywhere they appear. The upstream packages
are in the namespace `@xstyled`--I'm going to take this a step further by using
my own namespace and adding a prefix, so that `@xstyled/system` becomes
`@agriffis/xstyled-system` and so forth.

```bash
rg --hidden -l --null @xstyled/ | \
  xargs -0 sed -i 's,@xstyled/,@agriffis/xstyled-,g'
(cd packages && for x in *; do mv $x xstyled-$x; done)
git add .
git commit -m "chore: fork"
```

Here's the new listing of the packages directory:

```
xstyled
└── packages
    ├── xstyled-babel-preset-emotion-css-prop
    ├── xstyled-core
    ├── xstyled-emotion
    ├── xstyled-prop-types
    ├── xstyled-styled-components
    ├── xstyled-system
    └── xstyled-util
```

## Step 3: Release

I only ever want to make pre-releases from this fork, so I'll update
`package.json`:

```
"release": "lerna publish prepatch --preid agriffis",
```

and then make the release:

```bash
npm ci  # clean-slate install
npm release
```

Here are the [commits on
GitHub](https://github.com/agriffis/xstyled/commits/fork) and the [resulting
packages on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40agriffis%2Fxstyled).

### Step 4: Use

Update my project to use my fork:

```bash
yarn remove @xstyled/styled-components
yarn add @agriffis/xstyled-styled-components@latest
rg --hidden -l --null @xstyled/ | \
  xargs -0 sed -i 's,@xstyled/,@agriffis/xstyled-,g'
```

Here's [that commit](https://github.com/agriffis/agcom/commit/93016d1dceb55aedd791086362de1cfe06ee19e9).

Now I can make changes to xstyled for my own site, and with any luck, it won't
be too much effort to merge upstream changes into my fork.
