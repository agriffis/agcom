title: Bash prompt update
excerpt: Updating a venerable bash prompt with powerline and nerd fonts

For more than a decade, my prompt looked like this:

<div className="post-image wide">
    <img src="/img/as-is/prompt-old-light.png" />
</div>

<pre className="ansi">
</pre>

Recently I've taken inspiration from
[Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) and
[Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) to revamp the presentation. Now it looks like
this:

<div className="post-image wide">
    <img src="/img/as-is/prompt-new-light.png" />
</div>

<pre className="ansi">
</pre>

Behind the scenes, the code uses the same essential architecture: there's a
scaffolding (`ps1_update`) and some utility functions (`ps1_quote`, `ps1_color`,
`ps1_segment`). The actual content of the prompt is produced by modules such as
`ps1_mod_cwd` and `ps1_mod_git`. These modules register with the scaffolding by
calling `ps1_register_module`.

## So what's new?

Other than looking different...

* Out of the box, the new prompt depends on [Nerd Fonts](http://nerdfonts.com/).
  Personally I'm using "DejaVuSansMono Nerd Font Complete." There are a couple
  ways around this if you'd rather: use fontconfig to merge Nerd symbols with
  your preferred font, see
  [here](http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/linux.html#fontconfig)
  and
  [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/10-nerd-font-symbols.conf);
  or you can override the various `PS1_CHAR_*` variables after loading
  `.bashrc.prompt` to use symbols already present in your font.

* There's a lightning bolt! The first segment in the prompt is the "micro
  status," which is useful for inserting summary icons. If you're in a project
  with a running Vagrant or Docker Compose, the lightning bolt will appear.

* You can add your own micro status modules by calling `ps1_micro` (rather than
  calling `ps1_segment` which appends to the end of the prompt):

        ps1_mod_smile() {
          ps1_micro "$(ps1_color bright magenta):-)"
        }
        ps1_register_module smile

* Modules can be registered to run/appear before/after other modules, instead of
  needing to register them in the specific order you want them to appear:

        ps1_register_module git before cwd
        ps1_register_module user first

* New caching functions: `ps1_cache_set` and `ps1_cache_get` rather than setting
  `PS1_CACHE_FOO`.

## How do I get it?

Well, just to make it clear, this is my personal prompt, not really a community
project. I'm happy to share, and you're welcome to use it! I'd also be happy to
know about bugs or ideas. But there's no package, installer, wiki or other
trappings--just a couple files to download:

* [.bashrc.funcs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agriffis/skel/master/bash/.bashrc.funcs)
* [.bashrc.prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agriffis/skel/master/bash/.bashrc.prompt)

If you install those in your home directory (or clone
the [repo](https://github.com/agriffis/skel) and symlink, whatever you like)
then you can load the prompt by adding this to your `.bashrc`:

    source ~/.bashrc.prompt

Let me know what you think!
