Thanks! I‚Äôm happy to accept this nomination. For those that I haven‚Äôt had
the pleasure of getting to know yet, here is an introduction for you:

My history with Gentoo goes back to 2001. I had been developing for other
distros prior to that and found my way to Gentoo by reading one of Daniel
Robbins‚Äôs DeveloperWorks articles. I jumped on IRC and helped solve some
early portage problems, particularly ‚Äútry vs. die‚Äù (which is famous only
in my own mind) and file corruption issues that were the result of writing
directly on top of existing files instead of moving the old ones aside
first. Daniel asked me to be a developer and I dove in head first.

Since then I‚Äôve worn a number of hats. I‚Äôve worked on a lot of
architecture issues, contributing to alpha and ia64 in particular. I‚Äôve
maintained or co-maintained a number of packages, including bash, mozilla,
firefox, thunderbird, mutt, mercurial, vim, xcut, xautomation, ctrlproxy,
lilypond, librep, rep-gtk, sawfish, plucker, subversion, jpilot and
baselayout. I also wrote mozilla-launcher, epm, echangelog, ekeyword,
eviewcvs and votify. I didn‚Äôt originally author keychain, but all of the
code in it is mine at this point. üòâ Finally, I was one of the original
trustees, but I chose not to run this year because I believe my skills are
more suited to making technical contributions.

Technical contributions are important for anybody wanting to facilitate
cross-project decisions. Sometimes a good technical solution will allow
two projects to forge ahead in peace when they were previously at odds.
When that isn‚Äôt possible, it‚Äôs important to get along with other
developers and find a way forward. I believe I get along with my fellow
developers. I have my own opinions, but I work hard to understand the
perspectives of other developers, and I‚Äôm not shy about backing down and
admitting I was wrong.

I look forward to serving on the Gentoo Council if I am elected.
