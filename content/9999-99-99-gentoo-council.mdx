<p>Thanks!  I&#8217;m happy to accept this nomination.  For those that I haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of getting to know yet, here is an introduction for you:</p>
<p>My history with Gentoo goes back to 2001.  I had been developing for other distros prior to that and found my way to Gentoo by reading one of Daniel Robbins&#8217;s DeveloperWorks articles.  I jumped on IRC and helped solve some early portage problems, particularly &#8220;try vs. die&#8221; (which is famous only in my own mind) and file corruption issues that were the result of writing directly on top of existing files instead of moving the old ones aside first.  Daniel asked me to be a developer and I dove in head first.</p>
<p>Since then I&#8217;ve worn a number of hats.  I&#8217;ve worked on a lot of architecture issues, contributing to alpha and ia64 in particular.  I&#8217;ve maintained or co-maintained a number of packages, including bash, mozilla, firefox, thunderbird, mutt, mercurial, vim, xcut, xautomation, ctrlproxy, lilypond, librep, rep-gtk, sawfish, plucker, subversion, jpilot and baselayout.  I also wrote mozilla-launcher, epm, echangelog, ekeyword, eviewcvs and votify.  I didn&#8217;t originally author keychain, but all of the code in it is mine at this point. 😉 Finally, I was one of the original trustees, but I chose not to run this year because I believe my skills are more suited to making technical contributions.</p>
<p>Technical contributions are important for anybody wanting to facilitate cross-project decisions.  Sometimes a good technical solution will allow two projects to forge ahead in peace when they were previously at odds.  When that isn&#8217;t possible, it&#8217;s important to get along with other developers and find a way forward.  I believe I get along with my fellow developers.  I have my own opinions, but I work hard to understand the perspectives of other developers, and I&#8217;m not shy about backing down and admitting I was wrong.</p>
<p>I look forward to serving on the Gentoo Council if I am elected.</p>
