About a year ago, I proposed a contest on #noise to write a sudoku solver. LIM
wrote us a driver and generator. Chouser, Mr_Bones_, and owend wrote solvers.
I started one in LISP but never finished it, to my shame...

One question that's always been in my mind is "How could we use a regex to solve
a sudoku?" The main problem seems to be the input: Regular expressions are
a language for searching, so you need the search space expressed in a way that
the regex can process it. The naive approach expresses all the possible puzzles
on the input, which is way too much data.

I usually think of a sudoku like this, where zeros are squares that need to be
solved:

```
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0
0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 6 3 0 0 0 0 0
```

The problem with this representation is that the zeros aren't searchable. The regular expression can't tell that they mean "any number 1 through 9". So for a first step, my solver replaces them:

```perl
$puz =~ s{\d}{$& ? $&.'        ' : '123456789'}ge;
```

So the massaged input looks like this:

```
123456789 123456789 123456789 4         123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 2         123456789 7         123456789
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 4         1         123456789
123456789 123456789 9         123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 6         7
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
123456789 7         6         3         123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
```

Now each cell contains the full list of possibilities for that cell. This is
searchable. And with negative lookahead assertions, it doesn't have to waste
nearly as much time backtracking.

The final output, after the second substitution, is:

```
9 8 7 4 6 5 3 2 1
6 5 4 1 3 2 9 7 8
3 2 1 9 8 7 6 5 4
8 6 5 7 9 3 4 1 2
7 4 9 8 2 1 5 3 6
2 1 3 6 5 4 7 8 9
5 3 8 2 4 9 1 6 7
1 9 2 5 7 6 8 4 3
4 7 6 3 1 8 2 9 5
```

Neat, eh? So finally, here are the two scripts implementing this solution. The
first script is the solver itself. It accepts a puzzle on stdin formatted like
the input above, converts it internally to the searchable format, and generates
on stdout the solved puzzle. The second script generates the regular expression
which is inserted into the first script.

sudre.pl
genre.pl

By the way, while this isn't the fastest solver out there by any means (it's
just brute force, after all), it solves most puzzles in approximately 0.01
seconds. That's 1/10 of the time genre.pl takes to generate the regular
expression in the first place.
