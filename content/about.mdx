title: Hi, I'm Aronâ€¦
---

I'm a software developer living in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I work with my
wife--together, we form [Scampersand](http://scampersand.com/), a software
agency building modern web applications for clients.

I'm also an ultimate player. To me, there is no more beautiful sight than a disc
in the air, and no better feeling in the world than sprinting, catching and
throwing.

And--like you--I'm human, muddling through life, finding my way. I worry about
the world, especially about how people treat each other. We each carry our own
fear and hurt, and with clouded vision we inflict our pain on others. We could
all use a bit more grace, patience, and kindness--myself included.

## ...and this is my corner of the Internet.

Personal websites are weird, aren't they? It seems narcissistic from the moment
you buy the domain with your name on it.

For me, it's a way to carve out a respite from the insanity of the monetized
web. This site is _mine_. It's not just some rented space on a social network.
There are no thumbs-up buttons, or worse, thumbs-down buttons! I used to have
Google Analytics on this site, but I killed it--I don't need to know if you
visited.

I use this site to share my thoughts, how-tos and experiments. Feel free to look
around, and if you want to get in touch with me, [email works great](mailto:aron@arongriffis.com).
