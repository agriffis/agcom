excerpt: Developing on a Chromebook is fine, if your habits match mine.

I'm using the Pixel for daily development in Python/Django, with [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton),
[ssh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en) to localhost,
[mosh](http://mosh.mit.edu) to home server, and [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) FTW.

### How it works

I do everything in two applications: browser and terminal. This statement
holds true on the Pixel or my desktop, and it's one of the key reasons that
the Pixel works well for me as a development front-end.

So on the Pixel I have a total of two windows. Right, you guessed it:
browser and terminal. They're both running full-screen, which is important
because it enables the terminal app to handle more keypresses than running
in a browser tab.  For example I'm accustomed to ctrl-w for deleting words,
but in the browser it pops up a dialog to ask if I'd like to close the tab.
Additionally this means that it's easy to toggle between the browser and
terminal with alt-tab.

The terminal itself is an ssh connection to localhost, specifically to sshd
running inside a crouton-built Debian chroot.  Doing it this way rather
than ssh directly to remote hosts means that I have mosh available so the
laptop can sleep or move between networks without losing my connection.
This is especially nice for using LTE while moving in and out of
connectivity.

I don't use the chroot for anything else. This way I'm not wasting time
trying to get a Linux desktop to handle the high resolution, and I'm not
switching between desktops. It's all Chrome OS plus mosh in the chroot.

On my home server my entire development session is in tmux, including
a vagrant VM running my Django server. This affords a lot of flexibility,
provided you're comfortable with terminal-based tools.

### Initial setup

On a fresh Chromebook in developer mode, press ctrl-alt-t for crosh. First
set the password for the chronos user, otherwise your Chromebook is easily
accessed by anyone on VT2:

    crosh> shell
    chronos@localhost / $ sudo chromeos-setdevpasswd

Install the crouton chroot:

    chronos@localhost ~ $ curl -L http://goo.gl/fd3zc > ~/Downloads/crouton
    chronos@localhost ~ $ sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t cli-extra -r sid

This will ask some questions, during which I set up my "aron" user in the
chroot. Next, enter the chroot to finish configuration:

    chronos@localhost ~ $ sudo enter-chroot -u root
    (sid)root@localhost:~# apt-get install -y mosh ssh sudo
    (sid)root@localhost:~# usermod -a -G sudo aron
    (sid)root@localhost:~# exit

### First time, and after any reboot

Usually I don't reboot my Pixel, rather it's either running or suspended to
avoid needing to run these commands often, but it's not that hard...

    chronos@localhost / $ sudo bash
    localhost / # enter-chroot -b sleep 999999
    localhost / # enter-chroot -u root install -d -m 0755 /var/run/sshd
    localhost / # enter-chroot -u root -b /usr/sbin/sshd -D

The sleep just keeps the chroot from unmounting. The directory is normally
made on boot by the initscript but I found it easier to create it and run
sshd directly. YMMV.

### Now to work

In a full-screen ssh window, I establish a connection to localhost. In that
terminal, I connect to my development session:

    mosh gargan.no-ip.org tmux attach -d

The only gotcha is that I still need to access my Django development
server. For that, I start a crosh tab with ctrl-alt-t, then:

    crosh> shell
    chronos@localhost / $ ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 gargan.no-ip.org

Unfortunately this needs to be re-established any time the connection is
interrupted, such as when the laptop goes to sleep. Mosh doesn't provide
port-forwarding, and I don't take security lightly, so this is the best
I've got for now.

### Advertent omissions

I don't actually use mosh directly, rather I use ssh keys with ssh-agent
and the following script (called "gosh") to jump through my home gateway on
the way to my server. It uses a short-lived ssh connection to forward the
agent to the gateway for the final hop:

    #!/bin/bash
    gateway=gargan.no-ip.org
    ssh -fA $gateway 'ln -sfn $SSH_AUTH_SOCK foo; sleep 30'
    mosh $gateway -- env SSH_AUTH_SOCK=foo ssh -t "$@"

I also install synergy in the chroot, so that I can control my Pixel from
my desktop keyboard and mouse whenever I'm on the LAN:

    enter-chroot -b host-x11 synergyc --no-daemon --name jasperodus gargan
