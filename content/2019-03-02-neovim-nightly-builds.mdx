title: Neovim nightly rpms for Fedora
excerpt: Now available on Copr

I've made nightly builds of [neovim git
master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) available:

    sudo dnf copr enable agriffis/neovim-nightly
    sudo dnf upgrade neovim python{2,3}-neovim

The builds run at 4am ET daily, if there are changes on the upstream master
branch since the previous build.

## How it works

[Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/) is a build server where
anybody can build and share rpms, similar to [Ubuntu Personal Package
Archives](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas). You can configure Copr to
use [rpkg](https://pagure.io/rpkg-util), which builds an rpm from an
Internet-hosted git repository. You can even set Copr to build
automatically via web hook when you push to GitHub.

The tricky bit is that most upstream repos don't have a spec file. So
here's what I did:

1. Fork the upstream repo, add a copr branch
2. Set up Copr to build with rpkg via GitHub web hook
3. Add a spec file to the copr branch and push it to trigger the build
4. Cron job to merge from upstream, update the spec and rebuild

My crontab looks like this:

```
MAILTO=aron@scampersand.com
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/home/aron/bin:/home/aron/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin

# Long-running SSH agent so nightly builds can push to GitHub
@reboot ssh-agent | grep export > .ssh/agent

# Run the build at 4am ET
0 4 * * * nightly-copr.bash src/copr-builds/neovim
```

You can find the [branch on GitHub](https://github.com/agriffis/neovim) and
the [builds in
Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/agriffis/neovim-nightly/).
And if you want to know more about the nightly builds, you can find the
scripts in my [rpm-tools
repository](https://github.com/agriffis/rpm-tools).
